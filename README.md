In the MiniProject_1 dir use cmd:python Twitter_miniproject.py username count

username = the screen_name of the twitter user that you wanna type

count = the number of lastest tweets in that twitter account that you want to extract image from

for example: cmd:python Twitter_miniproject.py SelenaActivity 23

after you run this command, you will find an .avi file for the twitter user that you typed and a folder in the dir which saves all the originall images and  labeled images
